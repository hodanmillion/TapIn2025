# Location to Chat Flow Fix Summary

## Problem
Users were getting an error when searching and choosing a location for their chat room in the frontend.

## Root Cause
The frontend location service was calling the wrong API endpoint. It was posting to `/api/v1/addresses` but the backend expected `/api/v1/addresses/detail`.

## Fix Applied

### Frontend - location.service.ts
```typescript
// Changed from:
const { data } = await api.post<Location>('/api/v1/addresses', params);

// To:
const { data } = await api.post<Location>('/api/v1/addresses/detail', params);
```

## How the Flow Works Now

1. **User searches for a location**
   - Frontend calls `POST /api/v1/addresses/search`
   - Returns array of matching locations

2. **User selects a location**
   - Frontend calls `locationService.getOrCreateLocation()` 
   - This posts to `/api/v1/addresses/detail` with place_id, address, and coordinates
   - Returns a Location object with a proper ID

3. **Frontend navigates to chat**
   - Routes to `/location/{locationId}`
   - ChatPage component loads

4. **Chat room is initialized**
   - WebSocket connects to `ws://localhost:3001/ws/{locationId}`
   - Room info is fetched from `GET /api/rooms/{locationId}`
   - Messages are loaded from `GET /api/messages/{locationId}`

5. **User can send messages**
   - Messages sent via WebSocket or `POST /api/messages`

## Verification
The complete flow has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Location search works
- ✅ Location selection returns proper ID
- ✅ Chat room creation works
- ✅ Message loading works
- ✅ Message sending works

## Test Command
```bash
./test_location_chat_final.sh
