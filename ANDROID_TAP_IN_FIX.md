# Android Tap In Button Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Mobile Environment Variables**
   - Changed `.env.mobile` to route all traffic through nginx proxy on port 3080
   - Previously, services were trying to connect directly to individual ports (3001, 8080)
   - All URLs now go through: `http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:3080`

2. **Enhanced Error Logging**
   - Added detailed error logging in `useHexChat.ts`
   - Now shows specific network errors, status codes, and server responses

3. **WebSocket Proxy Configuration**
   - Updated nginx to properly proxy WebSocket connections
   - Changed from exact match to regex pattern for `/ws` paths

4. **Nginx Hex API Routing**
   - Confirmed hex endpoints are correctly proxied through nginx
   - Path: `/api/v1/hex/*` → `address:8000`

## Testing Steps

1. **Rebuild the Android app**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   npx cap sync
   npx cap open android
   ```

2. **Build and install APK on device**

3. **Test the tap in button**:
   - Ensure location permissions are granted
   - Click "TAP IN" button
   - Check console logs for detailed error information

4. **Debug connectivity**:
   - Navigate to `/debug` page in the app
   - Run connectivity tests
   - Verify all endpoints return success

## What Should Work Now

- ✅ Geolocation request
- ✅ Hex API calls through nginx proxy
- ✅ WebSocket connections for hex chat
- ✅ Proper error messages if something fails

## Monitoring

Watch the logs while testing:
```bash
# Frontend logs
docker-compose logs -f frontend

# Address service (hex API)
docker-compose logs -f address

# Chat service (WebSocket)
docker-compose logs -f chat
```
