# Message Format Fix Summary

## Problem
Messages sent from the frontend service to local chat rooms were not showing up in the Redis pub/sub channel managed by the chat service.

## Root Cause
The frontend was sending WebSocket messages in an incorrect format. The backend expects messages to follow the serde tag/content pattern defined in `models.rs`:

```rust
#[serde(tag = "type", content = "data")]
pub enum WsMessage {
    Join { user_id: String, username: String, token: String },
    Message { content: String },
    // ...
}
```

This means messages must be structured as:
```json
{
  "type": "MessageType",
  "data": {
    // message fields here
  }
}
```

But the frontend was sending messages without the `data` wrapper:
```json
{
  "type": "Message",
  "content": "message text"  // ❌ Wrong - missing data wrapper
}
```

## Files Fixed

1. **frontend/src/features/chat/pages/ChatPage.tsx** (line 75-80)
   - Changed from: `{ type: 'Message', content: trimmedMessage }`
   - Changed to: `{ type: 'Message', data: { content: trimmedMessage } }`

2. **frontend/src/app/providers/SocketProvider.tsx** (line 54-61)
   - Changed from: `{ type: 'Join', user_id: user.id, username: user.username, token: token }`
   - Changed to: `{ type: 'Join', data: { user_id: user.id, username: user.username, token: token } }`

3. **frontend/src/features/chat/components/LocalChatInterface.tsx**
   - Already had the correct format ✅

## Verification
Created `test_message_format_fix.js` which confirms:
- Messages with the correct format (with `data` wrapper) are successfully published to Redis pub/sub
- Messages without the `data` wrapper are silently ignored by the backend
- The Redis channel `room:{location_id}` receives the NewMessage events properly

## Test Results
```
✅ Messages WITH data wrapper -> Published to Redis pub/sub
❌ Messages WITHOUT data wrapper -> Ignored by backend
```

## Impact
Now messages sent from the frontend are properly:
1. Parsed by the WebSocket handler in the chat service
2. Saved to MongoDB
3. Broadcast to all users in the room via Redis pub/sub
4. Received by other connected clients in the same local chat room

The issue is now fully resolved.
